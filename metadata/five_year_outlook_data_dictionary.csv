pwsid,ID number associated with water system in the supplier service area. We created a lookup table to map DWR_ORG_ID and PWSID using the UWMP data. Note that there are some cases where the PWSID is NA and some cases where there are multiple PWSIDs.,nominal,UWMP,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
is_multiple_pwsid,"Indicates if there are multiple PWSIDs associated with values reported by the DWR_ORG_ID. If there are multiple PWSIDs they are included as a list in the ""pwsid"" column so as not to result in duplicating data (e.g. if org_id has a value of 1 for a given row if we added a row for each pwsid this could result in data being duplicated).",nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
