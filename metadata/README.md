# README

This data package was compiled as part of the Making Urban Water Data Public and Useful
project convened by the California Water Data Consortium, Department of Water Resources,
and State Water Resource and Control Board. The goal of this specific data package
is to make data accessible and useful for analyses related to understanding drought
vulnerability and impacts at the urban water supplier level.

The tables included in this package pull data from resources maintained by DWR and SWB. 
The utility of the tables in this package is that they exist together in a centralized
location, are processed to improve usability, and have metadata attached to ensure
data are used appropriately.

The 5 tables compiled for this package include:
- monthly_water_shortage_outlook
- five_year_water_shortage_outlook
- source_name
- actual_water_shortage_level
- historical_production_delivery

There is a data dictionary for each table and a methods document that provides context
about where data are sourced from, data use limitations, and any documentation that may
exist. 

We intend to also include a data management plan for this package (still in development)
that will exist in the GitHub repository used to generate the data and metadata for this
package.
