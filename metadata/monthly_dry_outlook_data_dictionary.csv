org_id,DWR assigned ID number associated with the urban retail water supplier. These data are reported by DWR_ORG_ID. org_id and pwsid can be used to connect data tables.,nominal,AWSDA,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
pwsid,ID number associated with water system in the supplier service area. We created a lookup table to map DWR_ORG_ID and PWSID using the UWMP data. Note that there are some cases where the PWSID is NA and some cases where there are multiple PWSIDs. org_id and pwsid can be used to connect data tables.,nominal,UWMP,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
is_multiple_pwsid,"Indicates if there are multiple PWSIDs associated with values reported by the DWR_ORG_ID. If there are multiple PWSIDs they are included as a list in the ""pwsid"" column so as not to result in duplicating data (e.g. if org_id has a value of 1 for a given row if we added a row for each pwsid this could result in data being duplicated).",nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

reporting_interval,"Describes how the supplier reported data in the AWSDA. Levels = c(""monthly (12 data points per year)"", ""annually (1 data point per year)"", 
""bi-monthly (6 data points per year)""). This field is helpful when using the data as there are cases where values may be NA if the reporting interval is not monthly.",nominal,AWSDA,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
reporting_start_date,"Describes the reporting start date. For instance, if a supplier reports by calendar year the reporting start date would be ""2024-01-01"". The year is based on the reporting year.",dateTime,derived,dateTime,N/A,N/A,YYYY-MM-DD,day,6/1/24,3/1/25

forecast_start_date,"Start date associated with the values being forecasted. This is based on the forecast year and month. Forecast year is based on the reporting start and end date. For instance if the reporting start date was ""2024-01-01"" then the forecast year for December would be 2025 whereas if the reporting start date was ""2024-07-01"" then the forecast year for December would be 2024.",dateTime,derived,dateTime,N/A,N/A,YYYY-MM-DD,day,6/1/24,2/1/26

is_annual,TRUE if represents an annual value. FALSE for monthly values. Annual values are included in this table and can be quickly identified by filtering the dataset using this field.,nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
is_wscp_action,TRUE represents shortage (or surplus) values associated with implementing supply or demand actions (Water Shortage Contingency Plan actions). FALSE represents shortage (or surplus) values associated with no WSCP actions.,nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
shortage_surplus_acre_feet,"The volume of water (acre feet) calculated by subtracting the anticipated unconstrained demand from the anticipated unconstrained supply. This calculated field is part of the AWSDA reporting. The AWSDA allows values to be reported in different units. For usability, all values were converted to acre feet. Negative values represent a water shortage whereas positive values represent a water surplus.",ratio,AWSDA,numeric,acre-feet,real,N/A,N/A,-812606,3419874
shortage_surplus_percent,The percentage of water shortage calculated by subtracting the anticipated unconstrained demand from the anticipated unconstrained supply divided by the unconstrained deman and multiplied by 100. This monthly number indicates the percent water supplies are short (or in surplus if positive).

state_standard_shortage_level,"Water shortage levels are predefined stages used by water management authorities to respond to varying degrees of water scarcity. Each level represents a specific severity of shortage and dictates corresponding conservation measures, restrictions, and actions to manage and reduce water use effectively.
