org_id,DWR assigned ID number associated with the urban retail water supplier. These data are reported by DWR_ORG_ID.,nominal,"AWSDA, UWMP",text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
pwsid,ID number associated with water system in the supplier service area. We created a lookup table to map DWR_ORG_ID and PWSID using the UWMP data. Note that there are some cases where the PWSID is NA and some cases where there are multiple PWSIDs.,nominal,UWMP,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
is_multiple_pwsid,"Indicates if there are multiple PWSIDs associated with values reported by the DWR_ORG_ID. If there are multiple PWSIDs they are included as a list in the ""pwsid"" column so as not to result in duplicating data (e.g. if org_id has a value of 1 for a given row if we added a row for each pwsid this could result in data being duplicated).",nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

forecast_start_date,"Start date associated with the values being forecasted. This is based on the forecast year and month. Forecast year is based on the reporting start and end date. For instance if the reporting start date was ""2024-01-01"" then the forecast year for December would be 2025 whereas if the reporting start date was ""2024-07-01"" then the forecast year for December would be 2024.",dateTime,derived,dateTime,N/A,N/A,YYYY-MM-DD,day,6/1/24,2/1/26

is_wscp_action,TRUE represents shortage (or surplus) values associated with implementing supply or demand actions (Water Shortage Contingency Plan actions). FALSE represents shortage (or surplus) values associated with no WSCP actions.,nominal,derived,text,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
shortage_surplus_acre_feet,"The volume of water (acre feet) calculated by subtracting the anticipated unconstrained demand from the anticipated unconstrained supply. This calculated field is part of the AWSDA reporting. The AWSDA allows values to be reported in different units. For usability, all values were converted to acre feet. For UWMP data, this field was calculated by subtracting the water_use_acre_feet from the water_supplie_acre_feet. When is_wscp_action is TRUE, the benefit_demand_reduction_acre_feet was subtracted from the water_use_acre_feet and the benefit_supply_augmentation_acre_feet was added to the water_supplies_acre_feet.",ratio,"AWSDA, calculated for UWMP",numeric,acre-feet,real,N/A,N/A,-812606,3419874
shortage_surplus_percent,"For AWSDA data this data is calculated within AWSDA reports. This is the percentage of water shortage calculated by subtracting the anticipated unconstrained demand from the anticipated unconstrained supply divided by the unconstrained demand and multiplied by 100. This monthly number indicates the percent water supplies are short (or in surplus if positive). This value is used to determine the State Standard Shortage Level. For UWMP data, this field was calculated by dividing shortage_surplus_acre_feet by water_supplies_acre_feet and multiplying by 100.",ratio,"AWSDA, calculated for UWMP",numeric,percent,real,,N/A,-99.88952,1063
state_standard_shortage_level,"Water shortage levels are predefined stages used by water management authorities to respond to varying degrees of water scarcity. Each level represents a specific severity of shortage and dictates corresponding conservation measures, restrictions, and actions to manage and reduce water use effectively. For AWSDA data, this is a reported field. For UWMP data, this field was calculated based on the shortage_surplus_percent. Levels = c(0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, NA). These correspond to the following definitions: ""0 (No Shortage Level Invoked)"",""1 (Less than 10% Shortage)"", ""2 (10-19% Shortage)"", ""3 (20-29% Shortage)"",  ""4 (30-39% Shortage)"", ""5 (40-49% Shortage)"", ""6 (Greater than 50% Shortage)"", NA",ordinal,"AWSDA, calculated for UWMP",enumerated,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,0,6
